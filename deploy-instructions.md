# üöÄ Deploy Your Portfolio to Vercel

## Option 1: Deploy via GitHub (Recommended)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
# Navigate to your portfolio folder
cd react-portfolio

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Initial portfolio commit - ready for deployment"

# Add your GitHub repository (replace with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-portfolio-repo.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up/Login with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your portfolio repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect it as a static site
6. Click "Deploy"
7. Your site will be live in ~30 seconds!

## Option 2: Direct Upload to Vercel

### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI

- You can also add a custom domain later

## üìù Notes:
- Your `vercel.json` is already configured correctly
- No build process needed (it's a static site)
